# Game of War

Project #2 - Game of War that auto-runs a 2 player game.

## Description

The Game of War is a card game in which players split a deck and play rounds until one player has all of the cards in the deck. Each round, a player draws a card and the player who played the card of greater value takes both cards and adds them to the end of their deck. If the drawn cards of the came value, the player "go to war", setting down 3 face down cards each and then drawing a 4th card each and using these cards to determine the winner of the round.
